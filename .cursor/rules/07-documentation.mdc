# Documentation Rules

## Docstring Format

- Use **Google-style** docstrings
- All public functions and classes MUST have docstrings
- Include: description, Args, Returns, Raises sections

## README Requirements

- Project overview and purpose
- Installation instructions
- Configuration setup
- Usage examples
- Phase-based feature list
- Cost considerations (LLM usage)

## Code Comments

- **Why, not what**: Explain reasoning, not obvious code
- Use comments for complex logic or non-obvious decisions
- Keep comments up-to-date with code changes

## Examples

✅ **Good Docstring**:
```python
def label_topics(title: str, summary: str, rules: dict) -> list[str]:
    """Label topics for content based on keyword rules.
    
    Analyzes title and summary text against predefined topic keywords
    to assign relevant topic tags. Uses case-insensitive matching.
    
    Args:
        title: Article title text
        summary: Article summary/description text
        rules: Dictionary mapping topic names to keyword lists
        
    Returns:
        List of topic names that match the content (sorted, unique)
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If title and summary are both empty
        
    Example:
        >>> rules = {'AI': ['artificial intelligence', 'machine learning']}
        >>> label_topics('New AI Breakthrough', 'Machine learning advances', rules)
        ['AI']
    """
    if not title and not summary:
        raise ValueError("Title and summary cannot both be empty")
    # ... implementation
```

❌ **Bad**:
```python
def label_topics(title, summary, rules):
    # Labels topics  # Too vague, no docstring
    pass
```

## Type Hints as Documentation

- Type hints serve as inline documentation
- Use descriptive variable names that document intent
- Prefer type hints over comments for type information
